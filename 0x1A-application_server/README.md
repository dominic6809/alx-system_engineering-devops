## Project Description

This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of application server setups. Key components include:

- Setting up and configuring a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
- Deploying a web application on the server
- Managing server resources and performance
- Implementing security measures for the server and application

## Installation

To set up the application server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x1A-application-server.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd 0x1A-application-server
    ```

3. Install required dependencies:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y nginx
    ```

4. (Optional) Create a virtual environment for Python dependencies:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Configure your web server according to the project's configuration files and guidelines.

2. Deploy your web application using the provided scripts or commands. For example:

    ```bash
    ./deploy_app.sh
    ```

3. Access your application via the server's IP address or domain name. Ensure that you have the correct firewall rules and security settings in place.

4. Refer to the `docs/` directory for detailed instructions on server management and application deployment.
