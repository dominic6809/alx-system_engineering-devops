# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

## Issue Summary
Duration

Start Time: August 14, 2024, 10:30 AM (UTC) 
End Time: August 14, 2024, 12:45 PM (UTC)

## Impact:

The outage affected the availability of our main web application, resulting in a 20% degradation of service for all users during the incident.

## Root Cause:

The root cause of the outage was identified as an unexpected spike in database connections, causing the database server to become unresponsive.

## Timeline
10:30 AM:Issue detected through automated monitoring alert indicating high response time and increased error rates.

10:35 AM:Engaged the on-call engineer to investigate the issue. Initial assumption was a possible network latency problem.

10:50 AM:Network latency ruled out. Investigation shifted to application layer. Checked application logs for errors.

11:15 AM:Discovered an abnormal increase in database connection attempts. Assumed a possible DDoS attack and initiated DDoS mitigation procedures.

11:45 AM:DDoS mitigation efforts did not improve the situation. Realized the issue was with the application code causing a surge in database connections.

12:00 PM:Incident escalated to the Database and Application teams for further investigation and resolution.

12:15 PM:Identified a code deployment that inadvertently introduced a database connection leak. Rolled back the deployment to a stable version.

12:30 PM:congratsDatabase connections stabilized, and application performance improved. System returned to normal operation.

12:45 PM:Incident officially declared resolved. Post-incident analysis meeting scheduled.

# Root Cause and Resolution
## Root Cause:

The root cause was traced back to a recent code deployment that introduced a database connection leak. The leak resulted in an excessive number of open connections to the database server, eventually causing it to become unresponsive.

## Resolution:

The immediate resolution involved rolling back the problematic code deployment to a previously stable version. This action closed the database connections, restoring normal system behavior. Further, a code review process was implemented to prevent similar issues in the future.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures
## Improvements/Fixes:

    Implement additional automated tests in the continuous integration pipeline to catch database connection issues during the pre-deployment phase.
    Enhance monitoring capabilities to provide early detection of abnormal database connection patterns.

## Tasks:

    Conduct a thorough review of the code deployment process, emphasizing the importance of code reviews and testing.
    Implement stricter controls on database connection limits to prevent similar incidents.
    Enhance documentation regarding the potential impact of code changes on database connections to raise awareness among developers.
    Schedule a training session for the development team to increase awareness of best practices related to database connection management.

This postmortem highlights the critical importance of robust monitoring, swift incident response, and a comprehensive review of deployment processes. By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to fortify our system against similar incidents in the future, ensuring a more resilient and reliable web stack.
